PROTOCOL:

- variable names for non-arrays cannot begin with integers
- fun language protocal dictates that you cannot access an array without having initialized it
- you can pass whole arrays into funs. If you do this though, you must indicate this through adding a "~" before the array name. (i.e. fun function(~array, numVar, numVar))
- you cannot access any elements outside of the bounds of the array (i.e. array of size three can access index 0,1,2) Anytime an array is accessed out of bounds, the program will output "404" to indicate the illegal access
