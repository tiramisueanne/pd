PROTOCOL:

- variable names for non-arrays cannot begin with integers
- fun language protocal dictates that you cannot access an array without having initialized it
- you can pass whole arrays into funs
- you cannot access any elements outside of the bounds of the array (i.e. array of size three can access index 0,1,2)
