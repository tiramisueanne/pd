So what is the game plan? 

Here is my idea.
Since we are going to be implementing security stuff, a good plan of action would be to implement arrays, but perhaps limiting ourself to creating an array in only one particular way, such as array a = {0, 1, 2, 3}. 

Then, once we have this array, we can index into it, such that a[0] = 0, or write into it. We can also through an error when someone tries to write an array out of bounds error. 

We could also reintroduce locality, which is what we were supposed to do but a lot of people decided against it.
